# API changes – Version 4.* to 5.0

## Conversion to bundle

Haste becomes a regular Contao bundle as of version 5.0. 


## AjaxReload component

The AjaxReload component has become a service and no longer accepts custom IDs:

```php
// Content element (old)
\Haste\Ajax\ReloadHelper::subscribe(
    \Haste\Ajax\ReloadHelper::getUniqid(\Haste\Ajax\ReloadHelper::TYPE_CONTENT, $contentElementId),
    ['foo-event']
);

// Content element (new)
$this->ajaxReloadManager->subscribe(\Codefog\HasteBundle\AjaxReloadManager::TYPE_CONTENT, $contentElementId, ['foo-event']);



// Frontend module (old)
\Haste\Ajax\ReloadHelper::subscribe(
    \Haste\Ajax\ReloadHelper::getUniqid(\Haste\Ajax\ReloadHelper::TYPE_MODULE, $this->id),
    ['bar-event']
);

// Frontend module (new)
$this->ajaxReloadManager->subscribe(AjaxReloadManager::TYPE_MODULE, $frontendModuleId, ['bar-event']);



// Custom (old)
\Haste\Ajax\ReloadHelper::subscribe('my-unique-id', ['baz-event']);

// Custom (new)
// No longer supported!
```


## DcaAjaxOperations component

This component did not change much, but we advise you to switch to the Contao core default features described 
in the [manual](docs/DcaAjaxOperations.md).


## DcaDateRangeFilter component

The class with static methods has been converted to a service.


## DcaRelations component

The DCA configurations did not change, but the class changes are BC breaks:

1. The `\Haste\Model\Relations` class has been converted to the `\Codefog\HasteBundle\DcaRelationsManager` service.
2. The model class has been renamed from `\Haste\Model\Model` to `\Haste\Model\DcaRelationsModel`. 


## Form component

The `\Haste\Form\Form` class has been reworked and contains some BC breaks:

- The `tableless` feature has been dropped.
- The form can now be initialized without the "submit check" callback.
- The `__toString()` method has been dropped.
- The `splitHiddenAndVisibleWidgets()` method has been dropped.
- The `addSubmitFormField()` method has a different argument order. Previously it was `addSubmitFormField($fieldName, $label, $position = null)` and now it is `addSubmitFormField($label, $fieldName = 'submit', $position = null')`.
- The `isDirty()` method has been dropped. Please use `getCurrentState()` instead.
- The `addToTemplate()` method has been dropped. Please use `addToObject()` instead.
- The `getMethod()` method has been renamed to `getHttpMethod()`.
- The `isNoValidate()` method has been renamed to `isDisableHtmlValidation()`.
- The `setNoValidate()` method has been renamed to `setDisableHtmlValidation()`.
- The `setIsSubmitted()` method has been renamed to `setSubmitted()`.
- The `bindModel()` method has been renamed to `setBoundModel()`.

- The `setFormActionFromUri()` method has been renamed to `setAction()`.
- The `setFormActionFromPageId()` method has been renamed to `setActionFromPageId()`.

Please refer to the [manual](docs/Form.md) for new code examples.


## Formatter component

The `\Haste\Util\Format` class has been reworked and is now a `\Codefog\HateBundle\Formatter` service.


## Pagination component

The `\Haste\Util\Pagination` class has been reworked and contains some BC breaks:

- The `__toString()` method has been dropped.
- The `isDirty()` method has been dropped. Please use `getCurrentState()` instead.


## StringParser component

The `\Haste\Util\StringUtil` class has been reworked and is now a `\Codefog\HateBundle\StringParser` service.


## UrlParser component

The `\Haste\Util\Url` class has been reworked and is now a `\Codefog\HateBundle\UrlParser` service.

Furthermore, it no longer accepts the page ID as a second argument. Please provide the URL on your own instead.

The `\Haste\Util\Undo` class has been reworked and is now a `\Codefog\HasteBundle\UndoManager` service.

Furthermore, the `$GLOBALS['HASTE_HOOKS']` and `$GLOBALS['TL_HOOKS']['hasteUndoData']` has been removed. Use the event
dispatcher instead with the `haste.undo` event.
